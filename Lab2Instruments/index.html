    <!--The goal of this lab is to explore and employ object oriented principles in terms of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. It comes in three parts: making a base abstract class, making concrete classes, and testing those classes.

Making a base class

Create an instrument class.

It should have properties for loudness, for family, and for play verb.

These properties should be set in the constructor of the class.

It should have a method for playing the instrument that logs, to the console, the family, loudness, and its verb. Something like "{{ family }} {{ verb }} at {{ loudness }}"


Making concrete classes

Make classes for woodwind, for percussion, and for stringed.

Each of these classes should take in a custom "loudness" to pass up to the super constructor. The verb and family, however, should be specified inside the child constructor.


Testing your code

Make at least one instance of each of your child classes, and put them into an array.

Loop through that array and call the play method of each of them - you should see the full message for each in your console.
